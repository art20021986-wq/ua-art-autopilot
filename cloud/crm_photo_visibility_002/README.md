# Technical source photos stay out of public galleries

Owner request: remove the technical specification screenshot from UA-0023 and
keep future photos submitted for OCR/data entry out of the vehicle gallery.

The permanent correction stops `ai_filter.save` from appending input photographs
to `photos`; inbox linkage and existing video behavior remain. Both public gallery
and cover selectors respect `hidden_photos` through the synchronization ledger.
Dedicated vehicle-photo editors remain available.

`public_cleanup.py` removes the already-published first frame from UA-0023,
keeps lightbox indexes and photo captions aligned, changes its cover to the first
vehicle photograph and changes its counts from 38 to 37. It preserves all other
catalog cards. The cleanup uses authenticated public HTML snapshots and exact
before/after hashes; existing page permissions are preserved.

The installer pins the actually observed reviewed source version, verifies its
exact plan again during backup, preserves CRM and pending requests, holds existing
writer locks, pauses/resumes the bot and verifies exact public bytes. Rollback is
rehearsed, including interrupted writes and a failure before any file writes.
A failed pre-write check never restores stale bytes over someone else's edit.

Status: 50 tests pass. R6 inspects all existing CRM-hidden galleries after the tracking release. The original failed read-only preview is terminal via the existing failure transition. No photo fix is installed yet.
